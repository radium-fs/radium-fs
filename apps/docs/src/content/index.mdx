# Introduction

**radium-fs** is a filesystem-level DAG caching engine for building interconnected spaces.

It manages a persistent pool of filesystem spaces. Each space is a real folder with a deterministic identity — same recipe, same input, same result. Spaces link to each other via symlinks, forming a dependency graph where nothing is duplicated and everything can be rebuilt.

## Why radium-fs?

Complex multi-agent systems need to share, compose, and reuse filesystem artifacts at scale. radium-fs gives them a shared infrastructure layer where spaces are created once, cached forever, linked instantly, and rebuilt on demand.

## Key Properties

- **Deterministic** — `kind + input → dataId`. Same input always produces the same space at the same path.
- **Composable** — Spaces declare dependencies via `dep()`. Symlinks wire them together in milliseconds, no copying.
- **Resilient** — Delete any space, it rebuilds from its recipe. Dependencies rebuild recursively.
- **Physical** — Every space is a real directory. Use grep, find, rg, or any tool you already have.
- **Runtime-agnostic** — Core has zero platform dependencies. Runs anywhere JavaScript runs.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@radium-fs/core` | Runtime-agnostic core engine (defineKind, createStore, types) |
| `@radium-fs/node` | Node.js filesystem adapter (requires Node.js ≥ 22) |
| `@radium-fs/memory` | In-memory filesystem adapter (browser + Node.js) |
