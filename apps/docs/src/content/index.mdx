# Introduction

**radium-fs** is a filesystem-level context composition engine for multi-agent systems.

It manages a persistent pool of filesystem spaces. Each space is a real folder with a deterministic identity. `dep()` links spaces with symlinks, so agents mount only the context they need and compose complex workspaces without copying.

## Two Rules to Remember

1. **Topology comes from `dep()`** — dependencies decide which context is mounted into each space.
2. **Reuse comes from `kind + input`** — same input yields the same `dataId`, so `ensure()` hits immediately.

If `task-context` input changes, only spaces whose input path includes `task-context` rebuild. Unrelated spaces stay reusable.

## Why radium-fs?

Complex multi-agent systems need fast context composition, not repeated context copying. radium-fs gives you a shared context layer where dependency wiring is explicit, rebuild scope is deterministic, and every node is inspectable on disk.

## Key Properties

- **Deterministic** — `kind + input → dataId`. Same input always produces the same space at the same path.
- **Composable** — `dep()` declares per-space dependency sets. Symlinks wire mounts in milliseconds, with zero copies.
- **Selective** — Input changes rebuild only affected dependency paths. Unrelated spaces remain reusable.
- **Resilient** — Delete any space and it is rebuilt from its recipe on the next `ensure()`.
- **Physical** — Every space is a real directory. Use grep, find, rg, or any tool you already have.
- **Runtime-agnostic** — Core has zero platform dependencies. Runs anywhere JavaScript runs.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@radium-fs/core` | Runtime-agnostic core engine (defineKind, createStore, types) |
| `@radium-fs/node` | Node.js filesystem adapter (requires Node.js ≥ 22) |
| `@radium-fs/memory` | In-memory filesystem adapter (browser + Node.js) |
